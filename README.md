# Section 3 Cube Dude
Keeping it simple we are going to make a simple character that is textured and fully rigged (Reference: CD_BCC)
Here are the lectures of the course for this section...

### 1 Introduction to Section 3
+ Michael welcomes you to and introduces what is coming up in Section 3

### 2 Importing Reference Material
+ There are several methods
+ Each has it's advantages and draw backs
+ Background images
+ Importing images as planes
+ Loading an image in the UV Image Editor

### 3 Object Mode And Edit Mode
+ The difference between Mesh Data and Mesh objects
+ Models can be made separately and joined
+ When to multiple mesh objects
+ Linked mesh data
+ Remember to Edit in edit mode, saves many headaches later.

### 4 Intersecting Geometry
+ Intersecting geometry good / bad
+ Angle makes a difference Z buffer distance
+ Closing Meshes
+ Animation can expose flawed areas
+ Linked Mesh Data

### 5 Creating New Geometry
+ Extruding
+ Insetting
+ Bevelling a vertex
+ Keep an eye out for double extrudes
+ Removing doubles
+ Deleting Loose Geometry

### 6 Adjusting Geometry
+ Loop Cut and Slide
+ Transforms
+ Edge Slide
+ Aligning with other mesh data, Snapping

### 7 The Mirror Modifier
+ Making everything separate and joining at the end works
+ Using the mirror modifier
+ Understanding reflection axes
+ Using clipping and merge options
+ Common mirror modifier pitfalls

### 7a Checking An Exported Model (In Unity)
+ Quickly check our model looks as expected externally to Blender

### 8 Quick Texturing Our Model (Blender Render)
+ After modelling is completed texturing can be done
+ Paint in the 3D window
+ Quick texturing methods

### 9 UV Unwrapping Overview
+ Smart UV Project
+ Seams
+ You can add mesh data to a mesh object but you might need to unwrap again an possibly re texture if you do that!

### 10 Optimising A UV
+ Controlling the UV layout
+ Alter the UV layout
+ Look at different ways to optimise
+ Packing islands
+ Understanding island margins

### 11 Creating A Texture
+ Painting in the UV/Image Editor
+ Applying materials to a model
+ Assigning a texture to that material

### 12 Checking Our Texture Works Externally
+ Quickly check our model looks as expected externally to Blender

### 13 Applying Multiple Textures To Our Model
+ Useful If you want to mock something out quickly
+ Works well with broad areas

### 14 Texturing Our Model (Cycles)
+ Brief recap of previous lectures
+ Setting up texture so it is visible in Cycles And Blender Render
+ Switch between Blender Render and Cycles

### 15 Minimum Skeleton Requirements
+ 15 Bones as a minimum
+ Hips are generally the root of the other bones
+ Name bones as you go

### 16 Automatically Linking Our Mesh And Armature
+ Fix bone orientation issue
+ Works great as good first pass
+ Can fail badly too
+ A look at what is going on

### 17 Vertex Groups
+ Understanding it is a way of grouping vertices
+ A Vertex can be a member of more than one group
+ This is used all across Blender not just for armatures

### 18 Checking Your Rig Externally (Unity and Unreal)
+ A Quick check to ensure what we have made is functioning as expected externally

### 19 Spaces Quick Win


### Limiting Joint Movement
+ Bone Constraints
+
