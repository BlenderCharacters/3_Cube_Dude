# Section 3 Cube Dude
Keeping it simple we are going to make a simple character that is textured and fully rigged (Reference: CD_BCC)
Here are the lectures of the course for this section...

### 1 Introduction to Section 3
+ Michael welcomes you to and introduces what is coming up in Section 3

### 2 Importing Reference Material
+ There are several methods
+ Each has it's advantages and draw backs
+ Background images
+ Importing images as planes
+ Loading an image in the UV Image Editor

### 3 Object Mode And Edit Mode
+ The difference between Mesh Data and Mesh objects
+ Models can be made separately and joined
+ When to multiple mesh objects
+ Linked mesh data
+ Remember to Edit in edit mode, saves many headaches later.

### 4 Intersecting Geometry
+ Intersecting geometry good / bad
+ Angle makes a difference Z buffer distance
+ Closing Meshes
+ Animation can expose flawed areas
+ Linked Mesh Data

### 5 Creating New Geometry
+ Extruding
+ Insetting
+ Bevelling a vertex
+ Keep an eye out for double extrudes
+ Removing doubles
+ Deleting Loose Geometry

### 6 Adjusting Geometry
+ Loop Cut and Slide
+ Transforms
+ Edge Slide
+ Aligning with other mesh data, Snapping

### 7 The Mirror Modifier
+ Making everything separate and joining at the end works
+ Using the mirror modifier
+ Understanding reflection axes
+ Using clipping and merge options
+ Common mirror modifier pitfalls

### 8 Quick Texturing Our Model (Blender Render)
+ After modelling is completed texturing can be done
+ Paint in the 3D window
+ Quick texturing methods

### 9 UV Unwrapping Overview
+ Smart UV Project
+ Seams
+ You can add mesh data to a mesh object but you might need to unwrap again an possibly re texture if you do that!

### 10 Optimising A UV
+ Controlling the UV layout
+ Alter the UV layout
+ Look at different ways to optimise
+ Packing islands
+ Understanding island margins

### 11 Creating A Texture
+ Painting in the UV/Image Editor
+ Applying materials to a model
+ Assigning a texture to that material

## 12

### Applying Multiple Textures To Our Model
+ Useful If you want to mock something out quickly
+ Works well with broad areas

### Texturing Our Model (Cycles)
+ Brief Recap of previous lectures
+ Setting up texture so it is visible in Cycles And Blender Render
### 99 New Ideas Below

Keep Your Models Simple
+ Using Modifiers to aid construction
+ Keep the model low poly for quick changes
+ Subdivision surface modifier Example
